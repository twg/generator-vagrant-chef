## Uploading your Chef cookbooks to Amazon S3:

You'll need the following applications on your system:

* awscli (macOS: brew install awscli)
* dialog (macOS: brew install dialog)
* berks (https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/)

Once you have those depdencies installed, you can run:

```
$ ./upload_cookbooks
```

Follow the on-screen prompts, and it will package your Chef cookbooks using `berks`, and then upload them to the specified Amazon S3 bucket.

Your configuration will be stored in `.deployrc` which does not contain any sensitive information such as AWS secret keys.
